Part one of the task was: "Imagine the following log-in webpage. Please think about possible test cases. To make it not too time consuming, please provide only headlines of the test cases (logical test cases - high level).
"

Here are options I came up with, tried to make it simple:

1. check it’s possible to login with valid email or casparid and password 
2. check ‘forgot pass’ sends email with restore link to correct email
3. check it’s possible to change pass with this link
4. check it’s possible to login with QR code
5. check if possible to set up another language
6. check it’s possible to login with valid email/password with any possible language selected
7. check ‘eye’ button on password field shows/hides password (should be hidden by default)
8. check fields clean data after page reload
9. check it’s impossible to login with invalid (user not existing) user data
10. check appropriate error message is shown after login attempt with invalid data
11. check it’s impossible to change password if change the link which was sent to email 
12. check it’s impossible to change password if new password is not meeting all requirements (if there are any)
13. check ‘Login’ button won’t become enabled if enter inappropriate (if there are any) symbols into login fields
14. check if the password is changed the user should not be able to login with the old password
15. check page looks and acts the same in different browser/os combination, also in incognito mode
16. check that window resize doesn’t cause page elements misplaced
17. some other cases you can come up during testing…
